The folder contains the following documents:
* Final Report for the research project
Jupyter notebooks have been provided for the following tasks:
* Comapring Levernbrg-Marquadt and Covariance Matrix Adaptation- Evolution Startegy for phase portrait classification.
* Classification of phase portraits
* Tracking critical points in phase portrait for motion anomalies
* A linear algorithm implpementation of the phase portrait classification
* Experimenting the algorithm on the UMN crowd activity dataset(make sure to place the dataset in the exact forlder mentioned within the code)
* Motion anomaly detected by change in fit:
